# My Portfolio Web Page
This is the repository for my portfolio web page. The page is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes details about me, my skills, and my recent projects.

## Features
- Smooth Scrolling Effect: The webpage contains a navigation bar that provides a smooth scrolling effect when navigating to different sections of the page.

- Contact Links Alert: An alert message will pop up when a contact link in the Contact section is clicked.

- Dynamic Navigation Bar Color Change: The color of the navigation bar dynamically changes based on the scroll position on the page.

- Title Case Function: A JavaScript function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.

- Fetch and Display Last Song: The webpage retrieves data from the Last.fm API and displays the most recently played song, including the title, artist name, and album cover. There's also a button to play the song.

- Responsive Layout: The layout of the webpage is responsive and adapts to the screen size. For screen sizes less than 660px, the header image is removed for a cleaner look.
